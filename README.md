# XgModel

**XgModel** is a machine learning project that predicts the Expected Goals (xG) value for football shots. xG is a statistical metric used to estimate the probability that a given shot will result in a goal, based on historical data and contextual features.

## What is xG?

Expected Goals (xG) is a widely used metric in football analytics. Each shot is assigned a value between 0 and 1, representing the likelihood of it resulting in a goal. For example, a shot with an xG of 0.2 means that, on average, 2 out of 10 such shots will be goals. The higher the xG value, the greater the chance of scoring.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to train a model that can predict the xG value of a shot in football using historical data of similar shots.
